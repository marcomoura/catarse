      chapeu: "To post a project through Coletivo Social, send project information including the total amount needed and the deadline. While we will promote each project received, it's essential that you let friends, family, and colleagues know about the project. Any value over 5.00 BRL (approx. 3.00 USD) can be donated, and as long as the funding goal is reached by the deadline, the donations go to the recipient. If not, the funds will be returned to the people who donated. If you believe in the project, you can make this happen!"
